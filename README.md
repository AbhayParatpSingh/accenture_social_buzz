About what we have done in this project
1. Create a final data set by merging your three tables together

We recommend using the Reaction table as your base table, then first join the relevant columns from your Content data set, and then the Reaction Types data set.
Hint: use a “VLookUp” formula
 
2. Figure out the Top 5 performing categories

Add up the total scores for each category.
Hint: You can use the “Sum If” formula

The end result should be one spreadsheet which contains:

A cleaned dataset
The top 5 categories.
We know that the client wants to understand the top 5 content categories. Have a think about what are the best ways to present this? In a pie chart? In a bar chart?

There are also some other interesting insights that we might want to share with them. For example:

How many unique categories are there?
How many reactions are there to the most popular category?
What was the month with the most posts?

It is now time to record our presentation to the client.
When presenting to the client there are a few things that you should remember:

They may not all be familiar with data, so you need to make sure you talk to them in business-friendly language.
 
You want to show them that you’ve understood their business and requirements, so use their terminology and language relevant to the task.
 
This is your time to shine and to show them how great you are! Try to present your work with confidence and conviction, if you don’t feel confident talking about your results then it’s a good indication that you don’t understand them fully or may need to revisit the dataset! Speaking about your results should feel natural when you explain what you’ve done.
 
A good presentation always takes a lot of preparation. The more you practice presenting your content, the more confident you will be when the time comes. Practice with your housemates, friends, family, anyone that is free! Ask for feedback and keep improving until you’re happy with your presentation and you’re confident in presenting your content.
